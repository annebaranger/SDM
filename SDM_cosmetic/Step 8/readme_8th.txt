"8th_step_species_climate_masking"

This script enables, for each species" the masking of climate variables' rasters with the ecoregions selected above.
Using the list of selected variables and ecoregions for each species, the script create new rasters (for each selected variables). 
These new rasters are reduced compared to the initial one because a mask is applied and removed all the data that are outside the selected ecoregions.
The result is a new masked raster, per selected variables, per species.

Climate maps are missing here cause it was too big for github but you can have it in BD_SIG CHELSA Bioclim ...
