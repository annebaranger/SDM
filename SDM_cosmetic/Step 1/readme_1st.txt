"1st_step_exctracting_potential_plant_names"

This script enables to exctract potential plant names from the initial Cosing_ingredients-frangrance inventory.
Thanks to a pattern recognition algorithm the script will extract all pairs of words that could potentially contain latin plant names.
The pattern recognition algorithm is based on an detailed observation made on the initial list to see where you could find plant names.
The results of the scripts is a table of pairs of words that contain plant names but also other substances used in cosmetics.
The next step will be to send this list to TNRS in order to assess which pairs are species names and which are not.
