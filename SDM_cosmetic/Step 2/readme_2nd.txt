"2nd_step_analysis_of_tnrs_results"

This script enables the selection of real plant names among the pairs of words submitted to TNRS.
According to the overall score attributed through the tnrs analysis, the script only keeps the pairs of words corresponding to real plant names.
For some species the detection is not good, that's why for an overall score between Ã  0.83 and 0.95 we investigated the names by hand.
The result is thus a list names of plant used in cosmetics. 
The name written in the list depend on the taxonomic status. For those who had one we kept the accepted name. For the others we used the matched name.
